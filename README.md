**Risk Management Experience & Cybersecurity Alignment**

**Profile Summary**

I am an experienced risk‑management practitioner with a background in developing and implementing comprehensive safety assessments across Design Technology, Engineering, and workshop environments. My work involves analysing complex systems, identifying hazards, designing layered control measures, and ensuring compliance with statutory and organisational standards.
These capabilities translate directly into cybersecurity and GRC roles, where structured risk assessment, threat modelling, governance, and incident prevention are essential.

**Core Competencies**

**Risk Identification & Analysis**

• 	Conducted full‑spectrum risk assessments across machinery, chemicals, electrical systems, and human‑factor hazards.    
• 	Evaluated likelihood, severity, and residual risk using structured methodologies.
• 	Mapped operational risks to control frameworks and compliance requirements.

Cybersecurity relevance: mirrors vulnerability assessment, threat modelling, and risk scoring (NIST 800‑30, ISO 27005).

**Control Design & Implementation**

• 	Developed layered control strategies including engineering controls, administrative controls, PPE, access restrictions, and environmental safeguards.
• 	Implemented safe‑system‑of‑work documentation and training protocols.
• 	Ensured machinery isolation, LEV compliance, PAT testing, and COSHH adherence.

Cybersecurity relevance: aligns with defence‑in‑depth, RBAC, configuration hardening, and policy‑driven security controls.

**Governance, Compliance & Documentation**

• 	Produced formal risk‑assessment documentation reviewed by senior leadership.
• 	Maintained training records, inspection logs, and statutory compliance evidence.
• 	Communicated risk controls to staff and ensured consistent operational adoption.

Cybersecurity relevance: parallels ISO 27001 governance, audit readiness, policy management, and GRC reporting.

**Human‑Centric Risk Management**

• 	Delivered training and demonstrations to ensure safe behaviour and reduce human error.
• 	Designed procedures that minimise misuse, unsafe actions, and operational oversight.
• 	Implemented supervision models and competency‑based access to high‑risk equipment.

Cybersecurity relevance: supports security awareness, insider‑threat mitigation, and human‑risk reduction strategies.

**Incident Prevention & Operational Assurance**

• 	Ensured regular maintenance, inspection, and testing of critical systems.
• 	Introduced access‑control measures (e.g., key‑holder restrictions) to prevent unauthorised use.
• 	Conducted ongoing reviews to reduce residual risk and improve safety posture.

Cybersecurity relevance: comparable to continuous monitoring, patch management, and incident‑prevention frameworks.

**Selected Project: DT & Engineering Risk Assessment** 

**Scope**

A full risk assessment covering:

• 	Woodworking and metalworking machinery
• 	Chemical handling and COSHH compliance
• 	Food technology and hygiene
• 	Textiles and heat‑based equipment
• 	Ventilation, extraction, and environmental controls
• 	Electrical safety and PAT testing
• 	Human‑factor and behavioural risks

**Key Achievements**

• 	Designed a comprehensive, multi‑area risk register with clear control measures.
• 	Introduced structured access‑control systems for high‑risk machinery.
• 	Ensured compliance with statutory requirements (LEV testing, PAT testing, COSHH).
• 	Reduced operational risk through improved training, documentation, and supervision.
• 	Created a repeatable assessment model that can be adapted to other environments.

**Cybersecurity Transferability**

**This project demonstrates:**

• 	Systematic risk analysis
• 	Control‑framework thinking
• 	Governance and compliance discipline
• 	Documentation and audit readiness
• 	Human‑risk mitigation

These are instrumental in roles such as:

• 	Cybersecurity Analyst
• 	GRC Analyst
• 	Risk & Assurance
• 	Security Operations (SOC)
• 	Compliance & Audit
• 	Security Engineering (policy‑focused)

**Technical & Professional Skills**

**Risk & Compliance**

• 	Risk assessment methodologies
• 	Control design
• 	Governance frameworks
• 	Documentation & reporting
• 	Incident prevention

**Cybersecurity Foundations**

• 	Threat modelling concepts
• 	Access control principles
• 	Defence‑in‑depth
• 	Security awareness & human‑risk reduction
• 	Policy and compliance alignment

**Operational Skills**

• 	Training & supervision
• 	Safety systems of work
• 	Equipment inspection & maintenance
• 	COSHH, LEV, PAT compliance
• 	Process improvement

**Professional Strengths**

• 	Analytical and detail‑driven
• 	Strong documentation and communication
• 	Able to translate complex risks into practical controls
• 	Comfortable working with technical systems and compliance frameworks
• 	Proactive, structured, and improvement‑focused

**Next Steps & Career Direction**

I am actively pursuing opportunities in:

• 	Cybersecurity 
• 	Governance, Risk & Compliance (GRC)
• 	Operational risk
• 	Security operations and monitoring
• 	Policy, assurance, and audit functions

My background in structured risk management provides a strong foundation for contributing to secure, compliant, and resilient digital environments.
